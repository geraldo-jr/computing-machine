Hyperloop Time Travel Calculator by Geraldo Pereira Junior
Design document

This document was updated after working through my code and analyzing it with a clean code perspective (concept based on Robert C. Martin's book). I altered the SOLUTION ALGORITHM part to make it more concise clean, by using more functions and better variables names.

Step 1) Problem Statement
I want to create a time travel calculator for Hyperloop technology. Users will choose a distance based on geolocations from point A to point B and click the button "CALCULATE." After clicking, the software will calculate how long it would take to make the trip using a Hyperloop transport system. The system will show the distance in miles and distance in kilometers as well as an image of a graphic map (using Google maps) of the distance and the time to do the trip.

Nouns - point A, point B, distance in miles, distance in kilometers, image of a graphic map, time.

Verbs - choose a distance, click the button (with function), calculate, show



Step 2) Defining Diagram

INPUT- 
	point A
	point B

PROCESS - 
	select point A with a selector showing the name of the city and state
	select point B with a selector showing the name of the city and state

	calculate the distance
	calculate time

	display the distance in miles and distance in kilometers and the time to complete the chosen route
	display image of a graphic map

OUTPUT - 
	distance in miles
	distance in kilometers
	travel time
	image of a graphic map


Step 3) Solution Algorithm
SOLUTION ALGORITHM:

main
  call function animationStart
END

animationStart 
  initialize visualAnimation = false
  initialize calculataingText 
  initialize counting

  IF visualAnimation == false
    visualAnimation = true
    alter #res area of the the html result tag  
    alter #showImg area of the the html result tag
    alter main of the the html result tag
    alter #calcButton area of the the html result tag
    alter #finalRes area of the the html result tag
  ENDIF

  Timer Condition setInterval
    IF counting >= 7
      stop setInterval method
      figcaption area html tag = "Calculating..."
      call validatingResults function
    ELSE IF counting >= 5
      figcaption area html tag = "Calculation Finished. Printing results."
    ELSE IF counting >= 2
      figcaption area html tag = "Finishing last details..."
    ENDIF	
    counting increment 1
  ENDsetInterval
END

calculateDistance 
  initialize cityTo
  initialize destinyOptions
  initialize destinyChosen
  initialize distancy
  initialize mapGraphicLocation

  destinyOptions = selector option of the city of destination
  cityTo = string of the destinyOption selector

  IF cityTo is "to1" value THEN 
    distancy = distancy of the city in miles
    mapGraphicLocation = file location of map image
  ELSE IF cityTo is "to2" value THEN
    distancy = distancy of the city in miles
    mapGraphicLocation = file location of map image
  ELSE IF cityTo is "to3" value THEN
    distancy = distancy of the city in miles
    mapGraphicLocation = file location of map image
  ELSE IF cityTo is "to4" value THEN
    distancy = distancy of the city in miles
    mapGraphicLocation = file location of map image
  ELSE IF cityTo is "to5" value THEN
    distancy = distancy of the city in miles
    mapGraphicLocation = file location of map image
  ELSE IF cityTo is "to6" value THEN
    distancy = distancy of the city in miles
    mapGraphicLocation = file location of map image
  ENDIF 

  return cityTo, distance, mapGraphicLocation
END

calculateTimeTravel
  initialize distance = call calculateDistance function
  initialize timeTravel

  timeTravel = ((distancy/760)*60) + 5

  return timeTravel
END

validatingResults
  initialize destination = call calculateDistance function
  initialize distance = destination array key number
  initialize cityOfDestination = destination array key number
  initialize timeTravel = call calculateTimeTravel function
  initialize messageText

  IF distance < 1500
    messageText = cityOfDestination + " is " + distance + " miles (" + (distance*1.60934) + " km) away from Eau Claire, WI. The time to travel this distance using a Hyperloop technology would be " + timeTravel + " minutes."

  ELSE
    messageText = cityOfDestination + " is " + distance + " miles (" + (distance*1.60934) + " km) is too far apart. Hyperloop transportation technology isn't worth traveling this distance."
  ENDIF
 
  call displayingResults passing messageText and cityOfDestination parameters
END


displayResult with messageText as a parameter
  initialize textResult
  initialize mapResult
  initialize createImg
  initialize map

  textResult = text place of result area in the HTML code
  mapResult = designed map place of result area in the HTML code
  createImg = create new img html element with a method

  clean the current text displayed on the screen

  textResult = messageText

  createImg = src attribute value 
  createImg = alt attribute value

  append new child on mapResult using createImg variable

END
