          This document was updated after working through my code and analyzing it with a clean code perspective (concept based on Robert C. Martin's book). I altered the SOLUTION ALGORITHM part to make it more concise clean, by using more functions and better variables names.

        <h3>Step 1) Problem Statement</h3>
<pre class="pseudocode">
1. Problem Statement: Create a time travel calculator for a Hyperloop transportation technology. Users will choose a distance based on geolocations from point A to point B and click the button "CALCULATE." After clicking, the software will calculate how long it would take to make the trip using a Hyperloop transportation system. The program will show the distance in miles and distance in kilometers as well as an image of a graphic map (using Google maps) showing the distance and how long it would take to make the trip using the system of tubes with low air pressure free of air resistance or friction.

Nouns - point A, point B, distance in miles, distance in kilometers, image of a graphic map, time.

Verbs - choose a distance, click the button (with function), calculate, show

</pre>

        <h3>Step 2) Defining Diagram (using IPO model)</h3>
<pre class="pseudocode">
INPUT- 
	point A
	point B

PROCESS - 
	select point A with a selector
	select point B with a selector

	calculate the distance

	display the distance in miles 
	display the distance in kilometers
	display the distance in time to do the trip

OUTPUT - 
	distance in miles
	distance in kilometers
	image of a graphic map
	the time to do the trip
